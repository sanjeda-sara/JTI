The missing sync.txt from android's ADB.

Message Format:
  Every message starts with a single 32-bit word. (Everything is little-endian).
  Depending on that first word, the rest of the data can have various meanings.
  Messages from the host/desktop to the device always start with a 'request'
    message of a u32 command, u32 size, and size more bytes that's a filename,
    directory or symlink.
  The command here is referred to as 'id' in the code and the 4-letter codes
    are prefixed by ID_, eg ID_STAT.
  The command IDs are the little endian hexadecimal representations of the 
    4-letter command codes.


  STAT:

    response:

      u32 command = 'STAT'
